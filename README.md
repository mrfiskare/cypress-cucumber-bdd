For setting up the Cucumber Preprocessor
[this guide](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md) was used. 
It also required [TypeScript](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support#Install-TypeScript) to be properly installed inside the project.
